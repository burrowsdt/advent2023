## About This Repo

Documenting my solutions and progress for [Advent of Code
2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). This is my second time attempting
the challenge.

Last year, I got through Day 8 in Python

This year, I’m starting off in R
<img src="images/R_logo.png" alt="R symbol" width="25" height="25" />
but might jump around a bit. I have not had much opportunity to code
over the last year or so, so my skills (what little I have) are extra
rusty.

Although I’m mainly focused on making it work and finding a solution,
I’ll probably come back once or twice to refactor the more
interesting/challenging puzzles, or to try a different approach with
performance benchmarks. No final answers are explicitly stated in the
code.

## Current Status
