## About This Repo

Documenting my solutions and progress for [Advent of Code
2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). This is my second time attempting
the challenge.

Last year, I got through Day 8 in Python

This year, I’m starting off in R
<img src="images/R_logo.png" alt="R symbol" width="25" height="25"/> but
might jump around a bit. I have not had much opportunity to code over
the last year or so, so my skills (what little I have) are extra rusty.

Although I’m mainly focused on making it work and finding a solution,
I’ll probably come back once or twice to refactor the more
interesting/challenging puzzles, or to try a different approach with
performance benchmarks. No final answers are explicitly stated in the
code.

## Current Status

Caveats and H/Ts:

- Day 1 -
  [ursulams](https://gist.github.com/ursulams/9e79aa2f478c83da14e78751139f03c2)
  for their approach to the mash-ups

- Day 3 - Had to do some serious troubleshooting and used someone’s code
  to get the right answer (whose? can’t remember!) for part 1, in order
  to work backward. Realized it was a super dumb fumble in my long
  chains of conditionals — one more reason to clean this up at some
  point!

- Day 5 - Part 1 was an eventual success but part 2 really threw me.
  Definitely plan to come back to finish part 2 but needed to move on…
